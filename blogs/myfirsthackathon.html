                    Welcome to the first blog of my portfolio.<br>
                    I had participated for my first hackathon - Hack-ccessible with the first years of the amHACKS team. It was the first time for the rest of us too. The theme was "accessibility" and we planned on making a Google lens clone for the blind but as a web app.<br>
                    We decided to build the app through Flask since Flask is easy (duh) and also we were quite familiar with it.<br>
                    To make the object detection part easier, we used an API. We never expected the setting up of the API to take so much time. It literally took 5 hours to set it up.<br>
                    Started out a little lost. But we picked up the pace slowly.<br>
                    The next challenge was to incorporate the webcam to the project. Luckily, we found a js script which does just that. All we had to do was connect the script to the Flask app.
                    But it wasn't over, we still had to connect the webcam to the Object detection API. It was a little tricky but we somehow managed to pass through it.<br>
                    Now, the UI. Decided to add a landing page to the app. Found a fitting template from the internet and gave an introduction to what the project does and a link to the app at the bottom.
                    Time was ticking and we had 2 hours remaining. The project was done and we had to work on the presentation.<br>
                    We made a quick presentation using Canva and incorporated a demo video.<br>
                    Everything was over and it was the time for the closing ceremony. We saw some amazing hacks, like a chrome extension that can enlarge font size of the webpage, change the color and lots more, we saw a project that can convert colors of an image accessible to color blind.<br>
                    Unfortunately, we didnt get any prizes. We realized that we commited a lot of mistakes from our part. We didn't give importance to the demo and the README of the repository wasn't that impressive.<br>
                    You know what they say: "Learn from our mistakes".
